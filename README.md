# My Solutions to Polchinski's *String Theory* Books

Polchinski's *String Theory* books are among the many classics that I have repeatedly promised to read but never started the second chapter.

That won't happen this time.

Of course, every physicist thrills at the thought of learning string theory. But apart from that, I have always wanted to write up my own solutions to classic textbooks, in case it should help a younger physics student. A more down-to-earth wish is that it will provide the spur I need to read the book from cover to cover.

For these reasons, I decided to start this project of posting my own solutions to *String Theory*. Any comments/discussions are welcome.
